A Desktop Search Tool with Advanced Indexing & UI Features
I developed a desktop search application using Python (Tkinter, os, fnmatch, threading, JSON), designed to provide a faster and more user-friendly alternative to native file explorers. The program allows users to search, browse, and manage files efficiently with an adaptable UI.
Key Features & Contributions:
Built with Python & Tkinter, with a modern Qt Creatorâ€“inspired interface.
Implemented multi-threaded search to avoid UI freezing during long operations.
Added drive indexing system (with JSON storage) for faster repeated searches.
Integrated sorting options (by type, name, or date) and real-time results display.
Designed a customizable UI (fonts, layout scaling, and context menus).
Added admin privilege detection and system-level integration (e.g., open files, open containing folder, copy path).
Delivered a smooth and responsive application adaptable to different screen resolutions.
Tech Stack: 
Python, Tkinter, JSON, OS utilities, Threading
